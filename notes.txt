Smelterys alloy every 4th tick

Tcon's Tile Smeltery has a method called alloyAlloys, this starts with a foreach, we want to inject into that foreach,
and continue if the alloy recipie on our list is allowed. A possibly better method is to replace the collection that
contains all recipies to contain only the ones we want.

Tcon smeltery parts all extend TileSmelteryComponent, so we need to as well, or it may not be recongnized
as a smeltery part
